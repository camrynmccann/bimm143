These water molecules only have one atom, which is oxygen, because the 2
hydrogen atoms present are too small to see.

The water molecule is conserved at residue 308.

After using the analysis of the sequence viewer on VMD, I think the
secondary structure elements that only form in the homodimer rather than
the monomer are the pink regions shown in the photo above. These pink
regions are helices, have nearly identical protein composition, and are
formed where the two momoners could interact in the middle.
